CSS - Cascading Style Sheets
    Where, Cascading in CSS refers to the process by which the browser determines which style rules to apply when multiple rules target the same element. The term "cascading" highlights how CSS applies a hierarchy of rules, where certain rules take precedence over others based on defined principles.
    CSS Properties are applied from Top to Bottom
    CSS Properties are overwritten when newly written at the bottom

Types of CSS
