User Defined Data Structures:
Stack
Queue
Types of Queue
Linked List
Hashing

Arrays (1 and Multi-dimensional Array)

Algorithms:
Searching & Sorting Algorithms
Recursion


Stack: (LIFO - Last In First Out)

From "Top" we can add & remove the data
Ex: Books, Chocolate Box
Linear Data Structure(1 Dimensional), where we can perform some operations:
Push - Add some data
Pop - Remove some data
Peek - check for data
Check Size of the Stack - check size of stack
Empty/Not - check whether stack is empty or full

Queue: (FIFO - First In First Out)

Linear Data Structure where we can perform some operations:
enqueue: Add the data
dequeue - Remove the data
front end - Fetching the first item
rear end - Fetching the last item
size of Queue - check its size
empty/not - check whether it is empty or not

Types of Queue:
1) FIFO Queue (Normal Queue)
2) Circular Queue
3) Priority Queue
4) Deque - Double Ended Queue
